\section{Computed LCSs in the ABC flow}
\label{sec:computed_lcss_in_the_abc_flow}

Having computed Cauchy-Green strain eigenvalues and -vectors for both
variants of the ABC flow (as presented in
\cref{sec:flow_systems_defined_by_analytical_velocity_fields}), we used
the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain --- i.e., the grid points satisfying the LCS
existence criteria~ \eqref{eq:lcs_condition_a},~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_b}
and~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_b} (the implementation of which are
described in
\cref{sub:identifying_suitable_initial_conditions_for_developing_lcss}) --- as
a first approximation to where we may reasonably expect to find repelling LCSs.
Four different views of the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domains for the steady
and unsteady ABC flows are shown in \cref{fig:steady_abd,fig:unsteady_abd},
respectively.

Note that although the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domains for the two
flow variants do not contain the same number of points (cf.\
\cref{tab:initialconditionparams}), the macroscopic trends remain the same. The
difference lies in minute details, such as the topmost cavities in
\cref{fig:steady_abd_z,fig:unsteady_abd_z} being of slightly different sizes,
or the point densities along the north east `bands' in \cref{fig:steady_abd_y,%
fig:unsteady_abd_y} being somewhat dissimilar. This is as expected, seeing
as the two underlying transport systems are lightly perturbed versions of
one another.

Using the filtering parameters provided in \cref{tab:gridparams}, we identified
initial conditions for the development of manifolds as a subsets of the
$\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domains --- yielding a total of \numprint{618} and
\numprint{676} points for the steady and unsteady variants of the ABC flow,
respectively.  Then, we computed manifolds and extracted LCSs using the
parameters in \cref{tab:initialconditionparams,%
tab:abc_manifold_params} and the method outlined in \cref{sec:preliminaries%
_for_computing_repelling_lcss_in_3d_flow_by_means_of_geodesic_level_sets,%
    sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points,%
    sec:managing_mesh_accuracy,%
    sec:continuously_reconstructing_three_dimensional_manifold_surfaces_from_%
    point_meshes,%
    sec:macroscale_stopping_criteria_for_the_expansion_of_computed_manifolds,%
    sec:identifying_lcss_as_subsets_of_computed_manifolds}. This resulted
in a total of \numprint{22} LCS surfaces for the steady flow, and
\numprint{31} surfaces for the unsteady flow.

The LCSs present in the steady flow turn out to form two distinct,
smooth and coherent structures, which are shown in \cref{fig:steady_lcss}. The
structures lie close together, yet appear not to be connected --- accordingly,
the two structures are highlighted by different colors for the purpose of
facilitating visual comparisons. Note in particular the correspondence between
the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$  domain, shown in \cref{fig:steady_abd}, and the computed
LCSs, shown in \cref{fig:steady_lcss} --- where the perspective of each
subfigure is the same as that of the corresponding subfigure in
\cref{fig:steady_abd}. Two prominent similarities are the tunnel-like structure
apparent in the middle right of \cref{fig:steady_abd_y,fig:steady_lcss_y}, and
the indent which manifests near the bottom right corner of
\cref{fig:steady_abd_x,fig:steady_lcss_x}.

The computed LCSs in the unsteady flow constitute three distinct, smooth and
coherent structures, which are shown in \cref{fig:unsteady_lcss}. Although
the structures lie adjacent to eachother, they do not seem to be connected.
Thus, the different structures are indicated using disparate colors, yet
again to facilitate visual comparisons. Just like for the LCSs in the steady
flow, the computed LCSs strongly resemble subsets of the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$,
shown in \cref{fig:unsteady_abd} --- where the viewing angle of each
$\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain subfigure is the same as that of the corresponding
subfigure in \cref{fig:unsteady_lcss}. The two largest structures apparent in
\cref{fig:unsteady_lcss} harmonize with the two dominant structures found for
the steady flow (see \cref{fig:steady_lcss}). The smallest structure appears
reasonable when considered together with the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain --- shown
in \cref{fig:unsteady_abd} --- in particular, it further enhances the
tubular structures manifesting in the middle right of
\cref{fig:unsteady_abd_y,fig:unsteady_lcss_y}, and the middle top of
\cref{fig:unsteady_abd_x,fig:unsteady_lcss_x}.
