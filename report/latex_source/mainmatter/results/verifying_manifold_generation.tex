\section{Verifiying our method of generating manifolds}
\label{sec:verifying_our_method_of_generating_manifolds}

\subsection{An analytical test case}
\label{sub:an_analytical_manifold_test_case}
As a verification test case for (our variant of) the method of geodesic level
sets to compute three-dimensional manifolds, we sought to reproduce a
three-dimensional surface defined by
\begin{subequations}
    \label{eq:sinusoidal_definition}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:sinusoidal_surface_function}
        z = g(x,y) = A\sin(\omega_{x}x)\sin(\omega_{y}y) + z_{0},
    \end{equation}
    which can be expressed as the zeros of the scalar function
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:sinusoidal_implicit_surface_function}
        f(\vct{x}) = g(x,y) - z,
    \end{equation}
    where $\vct{x}$ denotes the Cartesian coordinate vector $(x,y,z)$.
\end{subequations}
In order to do so, we computed its unit normal vector field as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sinusoidal_normal_vector_field}
    \vct{n}(\vct{x}) = \frac{\grad{f(\vct{x})}}{\norm{\grad{f(\vct{x})}}},
\end{equation}
which we then substituted for the $\vct{\xi}_{3}$-direction field
in \cref{eq:revised_direction_field}. Here, we chose the parameters
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sinusoidal_surface_params}
    A=1,\quad \omega_{x}=\omega_{y}=2, \quad z_{0} = \pi
\end{equation}
and used a single initial position $\vct{x}_{0} = (\pi,\pi,\pi)$ from which
to develop the surface, by subsequently adding mesh points organized in level
sets, as outlined in
\cref{sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points,%
    sec:managing_mesh_accuracy,%
    sec:continuously_reconstructing_three_dimensional_manifold_surfaces_from_point_meshes,%
    sec:macroscale_stopping_criteria_for_the_expansion_of_computed_manifolds}.

Specifically, we computed a total of seven surface approximations, using
the parameter values provided in \cref{tab:sinusoidal_manifold_params} with
different values of $\Delta_{\min}$, thereby using different mesh point
densities. Four of the resulting manifolds are shown in
\cref{fig:sinusoidal_manifolds}. Although all of the presented manifolds
successfully encapsulate the macroscale behaviour of the underlying surface
(given by \cref{eq:sinusoidal_definition,eq:sinusoidal_surface_params}),
increasing the mesh point density clearly facilitates more accurate
approximations. In particular, some of the visual discrepancies of
\cref{fig:sinusoidal_manifolds} can be attributed to the linear interpolation
inherent to our triangulation scheme (see
\cref{sec:continuously_reconstructing_three_dimensional_manifold_surfaces_%
from_point_meshes}).

\input{mainmatter/results/tables/sinusoidal_params.tex}

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/sinusoidalmanifolds.tex}

In order to obtain a quantitative measure of how an increase in the mesh
point density impacts the accuracy of the overall approximation, we
computed the root mean square (hereafter abbreviated to RMS) error of each mesh
point as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:sinusoidal_rms}
    \text{err}_{\text{RMS}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i,j}\abs{z_{i,j}-g(x_{i},y_{j})}^{2}},
\end{equation}
where we sum over all of the $N$ computed points, with $g(x,y)$ given
by \cref{eq:sinusoidal_definition} (and \cref{eq:sinusoidal_surface_params}).
The RMS error is shown as a function of the mesh point density in
\cref{fig:sinusoidal_manifold_errors}. It appears to scale quadratically
with $\Delta_{\min}$, the smallest permitted separation between neighboring
mesh points --- which doubles as a measurement of the overall mesh density.

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/sinusoidalerror.tex}

Note that, due to the local (pseudo-)planar nature of the parametrization of
manifolds by means of points organized in level sets, the number of mesh points
in the parametrization of a manifold \emph{increases} quadratically as
$\Delta_{\min}$ decreases. Thus, the decrease in numerical error comes at the
cost of an increased consumption of computational resources. For instance,
the method's most computationally costly operations (namely, generating
trajectories to identify new mesh points and checking for self-intersections,
cf.\ sections~\ref{sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points} and
\ref{sub:continuous_self_intersection_checks}, respectively) need to be
performed far more frequently when the number of mesh points increase.
Perhaps more crucially, an increased number of mesh points leads to an
increase in the required memory. These considerations, together with the
ones to follow in the immediately forthcoming section, became the foundation
on which we based our choice of mesh point density for the computation of
LCSs (which will be elaborated upon in \cref{sec:computed_lcss_in_the_abc_flow,%
sec:computed_lcss_in_the_forde_fjord}).

\subsection{Sample manifolds computed from the steady ABC flow}
\label{sub:sample_manifolds_computed_from_the_steady_abc_flow}

\Cref{fig:abc_manifold_convergence} shows a sample manifold obtained for the
steady ABC flow (cf.\
\cref{sec:flow_systems_defined_by_analytical_velocity_fields}), computed for a
few different mesh point densities, and otherwise similar parameters as were
used in order to approximate the sinusoidal surface (see
\cref{tab:sinusoidal_manifold_params,fig:sinusoidal_manifolds}). From
\cref{fig:abc_manifold_convergence}, it is apparent that increasing the mesh
point density generally results in increased resolution. However, there appears
to be some density threshold, beneath which unwanted numerical artifacts
start to emerge. This is particularly evident in
\cref{fig:abc_manifold_minsep=0.01}, where the sharp indentation appears to be
out of place. Such oddities could be due to accumulation of interpolation
error when computing new mesh points from ficticious ancestor points
(as described in \cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}) --- which naturally
occurs more often with increased mesh point density. Accordingly, our
choice of mesh point density for (both variants of) the ABC flow (which will be
presented in \cref{tab:abc_manifold_params}) was guided by a desire to limit the
amount of such oddities, in addition to the memory required in order to store
each manifold (as described in \cref{sub:an_analytical_manifold_test_case}).

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/convergence.tex}

Motivated by \cref{rmk:invariance_lcs}, we sought to verify that our computed
manifolds, by virtue of containing repelling LCSs, act as invariant manifolds
for arbitrary linear combinations of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$- and
$\vct{\xi}_{2}$-direction fields. \Cref{fig:verification_of_manifold_invariance}
shows a sample manifold obtained for the steady ABC flow (described in detail
in \cref{sec:flow_systems_defined_by_analytical_velocity_fields}), using the
parameter values provided in \cref{tab:abc_manifold_params} --- the very same
that we used in order to compute LCSs in said flow (more to follow in
\cref{sec:computed_lcss_in_the_abc_flow}). It also shows $200$ different
trajectories launched from (a small circle laying within the manifold, centered
in) the manifold epicentre $\vct{x}_{0}$ and computed using the Dormand-Prince
8(7) adaptive ODE solver (see
\cref{tab:butcherdopri87,%
sub:the_implementation_of_dynamic_runge_kutta_step_size}). In
\cref{fig:verification_forced_outwards}, the trajectories are solution
curves of \cref{eq:revised_direction_field}, where $\vct{t}_{i,j}$ was kept
constant along each trajectory. Meanwhile,
\cref{fig:verification_pure_linear_combination} shows solution curves
of \cref{eq:dynamialsystem_initialposition}, for $200$ different pairs of
weights $(a,b)$ such that the initial trajectory directions were evenly
distributed in the plane defined by the coordinate $\vct{x}_{0}$ and
the unit normal $\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})$.

\input{mainmatter/results/figures/verification.tex}

Unsurprisingly, the  curves in \cref{fig:verification_forced_outwards} all lie
within the computed manifold, as all of its constituent mesh points were
computed as endpoints of trajectories in a similarly defined direction field
(see \cref{sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points}). The same
applies for the curves shown in \cref{fig:verification_pure_linear_combination};
however, there seems to be some regions of the manifold which are particularly
challenging to hit --- signified by a decreased trajectory density ---
it appears that very specific weights $(a,b)$ are required to reach them.
Regardless, none of the computed trajectories ever leave the computed
surface, which confirms that the surface \emph{is} in fact an invariant
manifold of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$- and $\vct{\xi}_{2}$-direction fields, in
compliance with LCS existence criterion~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_c}.
