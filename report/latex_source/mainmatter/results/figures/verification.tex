    {Trajectories orthogonal to the $\vct{\xi}_{3}$-direction field,
        superimposed onto a computed manifold surface in the steady ABC flow.
        The manifold was computed using the parameters given in
        \cref{tab:abc_manifold_params}. The trajectories were computed as
        solution curves of equations~\eqref{eq:revised_direction_field} and
        \eqref{eq:dynamialsystem_initialposition}, respectively, starting at (a
        small circle laying within the manifold, centered in) the manifold
        epicentre $\vct{x}_{0}$. Note how none of the trajectories ever leave
        the manifold. The trajectories shown in
        (\subref*{fig:verification_forced_outwards}) cover the entire manifold,
        which is as expected, as the manifold mesh points were computed as end
        points of trajectories in a similar direction field (cf.\
        \cref{sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points}). The
        trajectories shown in
        (\subref*{fig:verification_pure_linear_combination}) never leave
        the manifold, but face difficulties reaching certain regions of it,
        as can be seen from locally reduced density of trajectories. For
        trajectories passing through $\vct{x}_{0}$, such
        regions are likely only accessible for very particular weights $(a,b)$.
