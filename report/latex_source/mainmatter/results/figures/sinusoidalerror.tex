    {RMS error of geodesic level set approximations to an analytically known
    three-dimensional surface, as a function of mesh point density.
    Using seven different mesh point densities (here denoted by their
    $\Delta_{\min}$), we computed approximations of the sinusoidal surface
    defined by \cref{eq:sinusoidal_definition,eq:sinusoidal_surface_params} ---
    four of which are shown in \cref{fig:sinusoidal_manifolds} --- whose
    RMS error (as defined in \cref{eq:sinusoidal_rms}) are shown as solid
    dots. Note how the RMS error appears to increase quadratically
    as a function of the mesh density.
