This chapter contains plots which illustrate some key properties of manifolds
(and subsequently, repelling LCSs) computed using the method outlined in
\cref{cha:method}. In \cref{sec:verifying_our_method_of_generating_manifolds},
we present geodesic level set approximations to a couple of three-dimensional
surfaces, and how these were used in order to guide our parameter choices
pertaining to the generation of mesh points in the general case.
\Cref{sec:verifying_our_method_of_extracting_repelling_lcss_from_the_computed%
_manifolds} describes how we verified our method of extracting \emph{repelling}
LCSs from the computed manifolds. Lastly,
\cref{sec:computed_lcss_in_the_abc_flow,sec:computed_lcss_in_the_forde_fjord}
contain the repelling LCSs we computed for flow in (either variant of) the ABC
flow and the FÃ¸rde fjord, respectively.
