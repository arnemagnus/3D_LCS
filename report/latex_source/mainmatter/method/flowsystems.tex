\subsection{Steady Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow}
\label{sub:steady_arnold_beltrami_childress_flow}

The Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (henceforth abbreviated to ABC) flow is a
three-dimensional, incompressible velocity field which solves the Euler
equations exactly. It is a simple example of a fluid flow which can exhibit
chaotic behaviour \parencite[p.204]{frisch1995turbulence}. In terms of the
Cartesian coordinate vector $\vct{x}=(x,y,z)$, the system can be expressed
mathematically as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:abc_flow}
    \dot{\vct{x}} = \vct{v}(t,\vct{x}) = %
    \begin{pmatrix}
        A\sin(z) + C\cos(y)\\
        B\sin(x) + A\cos(z)\\
        C\sin(y) + B\cos(x)
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $A$, $B$ and $C$ are parameters which dictate the nature of the flow
pattern. The inherent periodicity with regards to the Cartesian axes naturally
leads to a domain of interest $\mathcal{U} = [0,2\pi]^{3}$, with
periodic boundary conditions imposed in $x$, $y$ and $z$.

Here, the parameter values
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:abc_params_stationary}
    A = \sqrt{3},\quad B = \sqrt{2},\quad C = 1
\end{equation}
were used, as has been common in litterature (e.g.\ by
\textcite{oettinger2016autonomous}), as these values are known to result in
chaotic tracer trajectories \parencite{zhao1993chaotic}. The time domain of
interest for this system was $\mathcal{I}=[0,5]$.

\subsection{Unsteady Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow}%
\label{sub:unsteady_arnold_beltrami_childress_flow}

Inspired by~\textcite{oettinger2016autonomous}, a temporally aperiodic
modification of the ABC flow (\cref{eq:abc_flow}) was made by the replacements
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:abc_params_nonstationary}
    \begin{gathered}
    B\to{}\widetilde{B}(t) = B + B\cdot{}k_{0}\tanh(k_{1}t)\cos({({k_{2}t})}^{2}),\\
    C\to{}\widetilde{C}(t) = C + C\cdot{}k_{0}\tanh(k_{1}t)\sin({({k_{3}t})}^{2}),
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
with $A$, $B$ and $C$ given by \cref{eq:abc_params_stationary}, where the
parameters values
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:abc_params_nonstationary_frequencies}
    k_{0}=0.3,\quad k_{1}=0.5,\quad k_{2}=1.5,\quad k_{3}=1.8,
\end{equation}
were used. The fundamental idea of this modification is to further enhance
the chaotic nature of the resulting flow patterns. Similarly modified
ABC flow has previously been at the centre of other three-dimensional transport
barrier investigations --- including hyperbolic LCSs --- such as the work of
\textcite{blazevski2014hyperbolic}; albeit with quite different methods of
computing said LCSs than the one considered here. Like for its stationary
sibling, the time domain of interest for this system was $\mathcal{I}=[0,5]$.
The time dependence of the $\widetilde{B}$ and  $\widetilde{C}$ coefficients is
illustrated in \cref{fig:abc_timedep_coeff}.

\section{Flow systems defined by gridded velocity data}
\label{sec:flow_systems_defined_by_gridded_velocity_data}

\subsection{Oceanic currents in the Førde fjord}
\label{ssub:oceanic_currents_in_the_forde_fjord}

In 2016, the mining company Nordic Mining ASA received permission from the
Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment to extract rutile from the
Engebø mountain in Naustdal, Norway \parencite{garvik2017gruvekonflikten,%
haugan2015sjodeponi}. Furthermore, the company were authorized to dump
the mining waste into the nearby Førde fjord; a legislation which has been
debated fiercely, and heavily protested against, ever since the original
application was submitted in 2008. Early estimates suggest that, when operating
at full scale, the mining operation will result in yearly oceanic mine tailings
deposits in excess of five million tonnes \parencite{garvik2017gruvekonflikten}.

Several centres of technical expertise --- such as the Norwegian Institute of
Marine Research --- have publically advised against depositing mine tailings
into the fjord, emphasizing the potentially severe negative consequences
for the aquaculture \parencite{haugan2015sjodeponi}. Not only is the surrounding
area a significant spawning ground for cod, there is always a possibility of
of particles being transported by the water currents such that they
contaminate the outer edges of the fjord, or even into the ocean. Accordingly,
the use of LCSs in order to predict possible flow patterns for contaminants
resulting from the deposit of mine tailings would be of great environmental
interest.

To this end, gridded three-dimensional velocity data, modelling oceanic
currents in the (depths of the) Førde Fjord, was made available by SINTEF
Fisheries and Aquaculture. The data set considered here contains velocity data
for the time period between June 1 2013, 00:00 and June 2 2013, 23:40, sampled
in intervals of 20 minutes. For our simulations, the time interval of interest
was the 18 hour time window between 00:00 and 18:00 on June 1 2013 ---
practically ensuring the encapsulation of at least one tidal cycle.

Seeing as some of the most harmful contaminants found within the mine tailings
are heavy metals, we concentrated our analysis on the depths of the fjord.
Accordingly, we looked for LCSs in a region of water which was neither
particularly close to the oceanic surface, nor hit the coastline when
advected for the 18 hour duration of the time interval of interest. This
limited our research to a
$500\,\si{\meter}\times500\,\si{\meter}\times250\,\si{\meter}$ region, with
depths ranging from $50\,\si{\meter}$ to $300\,\si{\meter}$ below the
surface. A bird's-eye view of the region is shown in white in
\cref{fig:currentmap}, which also contains a map view of the geographical
region.

\subsection{Interpolating gridded velocity data}
\label{sub:interpolating_gridded_velocity_data}








In order to identify LCSs in three-dimensional flow by means of geodesic level
set approximations, a system which has been studied extensively in the
literature was chosen. The system is a simple example of a fluid flow which can
exhibit chaotic behaviour \parencite[p.204]{frisch1995turbulence}.
