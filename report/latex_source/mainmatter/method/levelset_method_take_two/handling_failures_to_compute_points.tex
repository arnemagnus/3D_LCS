\subsection{Handling failures to compute satisfactory mesh points}
\label{sub:handling_failures_to_compute_satisfactory_mesh_points_revised}

Much like the legacy approach outlined in
\cref{sec:legacy_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points}, it can never be
guaranteed that all of the computed trajectories will yield new, acceptable
mesh points --- moreover, missing out on points in a level set prohibits
the generation of more level set. In particular, our procedure for maintaining
mesh accuracy (which will be outlined in
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}) makes extensive use of the
interpolation curves $\{\mathcal{C}_{i}\}$. As the smoothness of the
interpolation curve $\mathcal{C}_{i+1}$ depends on \emph{all} of the points used
for its creation, proper handling of tricky mesh points remains critically
important.

Seeing as the only tolerance parameter involved in this method pertains to
achieving the desired separation between a meshpoint and its direct descendant
--- see \cref{eq:revised_dist_tol} --- we elected not to progressively relax
this  constraint. Instead, we interpreted the failure of any trajectory to reach
a point sufficiently far away, as the trajectory being coiled such that the
required integration arc length to yield a point sufficiently far away from
the ancestor mesh point pre-set allowed path length. Accordingly, the incomplete
level set was discarded, and attempted to be recomputed with reduced
$\Delta_{i}$ (for which the dynamic adjustment procedure will be described
in detail in
\cref{sub:a_curvature_based_approach_to_determining_inter_set_separations}).
Should an entire, new geodesic level set prove incomputable even at the
minimum permitted step length, attempts at further expansion of the computed
manifold were abandoned. In such cases, this variant of the method of geodesic
level sets simply did not suffice, for the given set of development parameters.
Details on other stopping criteria for the generation of manifolds will be
presented in
\cref{sec:stopping_criteria_for_the_expansion_of_computed_manifolds}.
