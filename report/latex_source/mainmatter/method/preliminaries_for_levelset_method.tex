\label{sec:preliminaries_for_computing_repelling_lcss_in_3d_flow_by_means_of_geodesic_level_sets}

Repelling LCSs in three spatial dimensions are quite challenging to compute.
Straightforward numerical integration of the flow is insufficient ---
in three dimensions, the existence criterion~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_c} provides
another degree of freedom, as, everywhere within such an LCS, one is
allowed to move `freely' within a plane which is orthogonal to
$\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})$. Dedicated algorithms are needed. Here, we consider
a (variation of) the method of geodesic level sets for computing repelling
LCSs as invariant manifolds of the $\vct{\xi}_{1}$ and $\vct{\xi}_{2}$ direction
fields (cf.~\cref{rmk:invariance_lcs}), as presented by
\textcite{krauskopf2005survey}. The short presentation to follow in the
next paragraph will be explained further in depth in the subsequent
subsections.

The method is based on the concept of developing an unstable manifold from a
local neighborhood of an initial condition $\vct{x}_{0}$ (how these initial
conditions were chosen will be described in
\cref{sub:identifying_suitable_initial_conditions_for_developing_lcss}).
In particular, a small, closed curve $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ consisting
of points which all lie within the tangent plane defined by the coordinate
$\vct{x}_{0}$ and the unit normal $\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})$, separated from
$\vct{x}_{0}$ by a distance $\delta_{\text{init}}$, is assumed to consist of
points which all lie within the same manifold as $\vct{x}_{0}$. The idea is then
to compute the next geodesic circle in a local, dynamic coordinate system,
defined by hyperplanes which are orthogonal to the most recently computed
geodesic circle. A set of accuracy parameters governs the number of next points
by which the next geodesic circle is approximated, in solving a set of boundary
value problems. During the computation, the interpolation error stays bounded by
the density of mesh points, so that the overall quality of the mesh is
preserved.

\subsection{Identifying suitable initial conditions for developing LCSs}
\label{sub:identifying_suitable_initial_conditions_for_developing_lcss}

Inspired by the two-dimensional approach of \textcite{farazmand2012computing},
in order to identify repelling LCSs, the first step was to identify the
subdomain $\mathcal{U}_{0}\subset\mathcal{U}$ in which the existence conditions
\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_a},~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_b} and
\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_d} are satisfied --- as these conditions can be
verified for individual points, unlike criterion~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_c}.
All grid points which lie within $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ would then be valid initial
conditions for repelling LCSs. Of the aforementioned criteria,
condition~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_d} is the least straightforward to implement
numerically, as identifying the zeros of inner products is prone to numerical
round-off error. Our approach is based on comparing the value of $\lambda_{3}$
at a given grid point $\vct{x}_{0}$ to the values of $\lambda_{3}$ at the two
points $\vct{x}_{0}\pm\varepsilon\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})$, where
$\varepsilon$ is a number one order of magnitude smaller than the grid spacing.
Should $\lambda_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})$ be the largest of the three, signifying that
$\vct{x}_{0}$ could be an approximate maximum of the $\lambda_{3}$ field
along the (local) $\vct{\xi}_{3}$ direction (which compliance with condition~
\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_b} would confirm), the point $\vct{x}_{0}$ would be
flagged as satisfying criterion~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_d}.

Using all of the points in $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain would invariably involve
computing alot of LCSs several times over --- in particular, if two neighboring
grid points are both located in the $\mathcal{U}_{0}$ domain, then they likely
belong to the same manifold. In order to reduce the number of redundant
calculations, the set of considered initial conditions was further reduced,
by only checking whether every $\nu^{\text{th}}$ grid point along each axis
belonged to $\mathcal{U}_{0}$, that is, only considering one in every
$\nu^{3}$ grid points in the entire domain as possible initial conditions.
Because the number of grid points was different for the different types of
flow (cf.\ \cref{tab:gridparams}), so too was the pseudo-sampling frequency
$\nu$. The values for $\varepsilon$, $\nu$ and the resulting number of initial
conditions are given in \cref{tab:initialconditionparams}. Note that, using
the given filtering parameters, the initial conditions reduced to a far more
manageable number of grid points, than all of the grid points which satisfy
the LCS conditions~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_a},~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_b} and~%
\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_d}.

\subsection{Parametrizing the innermost level set}
\label{sub:parametrizing_the_innermost_level_set}

For an initial condition $\vct{x}_{0}$ identified by means of the method
outlined in
\cref{sub:identifying_suitable_initial_conditions_for_developing_lcss}, the
corresponding LCS must locally be tangent to the plane with unit normal given
by $\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})$, as a consequence of LCS existence criterion~%
\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_c}. Accordingly, the first geodesic level set is
approximated by a set of $n$ points $\{\mathcal{M}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$, which all
lie within the aforementioned tangent plane, separated from $\vct{x}_{0}$ by a
distance $\delta_{\text{init}}$; all of which assumed to lie within the same
manifold. The parameter $\delta_{\text{init}}$ was chosen small compared to the
grid spacing, in order to limit the inherent errors of this linearization.

An interpolation curve $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ was then made, with a view to
representing the innermost level set in a smoother fashion. In particular,
this interpolation curve was designed as a parametric spline. To this end,
the points $\{\mathcal{M}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$ were first ordered in clockwise
or counterclockwise --- merely a matter of perspective --- fashion. Then,
each mesh point was assigned an independent variable $s$ based upon the
cumulative interpoint distance along the ordered list of points, starting
at $j=1$; estimated by means of the Euclidean norm, then normalized by dividing
$s$ through by the total interpoint distance around the entire initial level
set.

In an intermediary step, the coordinates of the mesh point
$\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$ was appended to a list containing the ordered coordinates
of the mesh points $\{\mathcal{M}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$, such that, aside from
$\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$, which corresponded to both $s=0$ and $s=1$, there was a
one-to-one correspondence between the $s$-values and the coordinates of the
mesh points. Then, considering each of the lists containing the Cartesian
coordinates of the mesh points as univariate functions of the pseudo-arclength
parameter $s$, separate cubic B-splines were made for each set of coordinates,
making use of the \texttt{bspline\_1d} extension type from the Bspline-Fortran
library \parencite{williams2018bspline}, which was ported to Python as outlined
in \cref{sub:interpolating_gridded_velocity_data}. The constructed innermost
level set and its associated interpolation curve is illustrated in
\cref{fig:innermost_levelset}. Interpolation curves for all subsequent level
sets (the computation of which will be described in detail shortly) were
made completely analogously to $\mathcal{C}_{1}$.

\input{mainmatter/method/figures/initial_levelset_and_interp}

In the following, let $\vct{x}_{i,j}$ denote the location of mesh point
$\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$. As suggested by \textcite{krauskopf2005survey}, we then
sought to develop a new level set, parametrized by a new set of points
$\{\mathcal{M}_{2,j}\}$ located in the family of half-planes
$\{\mathcal{H}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$, extending radially outwards from the
corresponding points $\{\mathcal{M}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$ in the initial level set
while being orthogonal to $\mathcal{C}_{1}$. These half-planes are generally
defined by the points $\vct{x}_{i,j}$ and the (unit) tangent vectors
$\vct{t}_{i,j}$. For the innermost level set, these tangent vectors were
computed as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:innermost_tanvec}
    \vct{t}_{1,j} = %
    \frac{\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})\times(\vct{x}_{1,j}-\vct{x}_{0})}%
    {\norm{\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})\times(\vct{x}_{1,j}-\vct{x}_{0})}}.
\end{equation}
For the subsequent level sets, \textcite{krauskopf2005survey} suggest
determining the tangents $\vct{t}_{i,j}$ using the interpolation curve
$\mathcal{C}_{i}$, by drawing a vector between two points equidistant to
$\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$ in either direction along $\mathcal{C}_{i}$. However,
an inheritance-based approach was found to yield more smoothly parametrized
manifolds, which were less sensitive to numerical noise. This approach,
along with the treatment of special cases, will be explained in greater detail
in the sections to follow (in particular,
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}).

A \emph{guidance} vector $\vct{\rho}_{i,j}$ was computed for each of the
mesh points $\{\mathcal{M}_{i,j}\}$, in order to keep track of the local
(quasi-)radial direction. The guidance vectors for the innermost level set were
computed as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:innermost_prevvec}
    \vct{\rho}_{1,j} = %
    \frac{\vct{x}_{1,j}-\vct{x}_{0}}{\norm{\vct{x}_{1,j}-\vct{x}_{0}}}.
\end{equation}
For each mesh point in all ensuing level sets, the guidance vectors were
computed relative to the coordinates of the point in the immediately
preceding level set, from which the new point was computed. That is,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:general_prevvec}
    \vct{\rho}_{i,j} = %
    \frac{\vct{x}_{i,j}-\vct{x}_{i-1,\hat{\jmath}}}{\norm{\vct{x}_{i,j}-\vct{x}_{i-1,\hat{\jmath}}}},
\end{equation}
where the indices $j$ and $\hat{\jmath}$ generally need not be the same,
as there is generally not a one-to-one correspondence between points
in subsequent level sets; see \cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}
for details.

Note that, in computing new mesh points, organized in level sets, a descendant
point $\mathcal{M}_{i+1,j}$ has to be computed for each ancestor point
$\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$. This is due to the method being based on parametrizing
manifolds as a series of smooth topological circles. Should this prove
not to be possible, given a set of tolerance parameters which will be
described in greater detail in the sections to come, the computation would
stop abruptly, leaving the manifold parametrized by however many of its
geodesic level sets were successfully completed. Further details on the
stopping criteria for the generation of new geodesic level sets will be
presented in
\cref{sec:macroscale_stopping_criteria_for_the_expansion_of_computed_manifolds}.
