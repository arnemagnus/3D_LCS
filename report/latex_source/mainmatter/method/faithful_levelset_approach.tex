{Legacy approach to computing new mesh points}
\label{sec:legacy_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points}

As tentatively suggested in \cref{sub:parametrizing_the_innermost_level_set},
each of the points in the first level set
$\mathcal{M}_{1} = \{\mathcal{M}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$ is used to compute a point
in the ensuing level set $\mathcal{M}_{2}$. This notion extends to all of the
subsequent level sets; namely, the points in level set $\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$
are computed from the points in the prior level set $\mathcal{M}_{i}$.
For reasons of brevity in the discussion to follow, we denote the points
$\{\mathcal{M}_{i,j}\}$ and $\{\mathcal{M}_{i+1,j}\}$ as \emph{ancestor} and
\emph{descendant points}, respectively. Furthermore, the set of mesh points
which can be traced backwards to a single, common ancestor, is referred to as
a \emph{point strand}. The considerations to follow rely on each mesh point
$\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$ inheriting its tangential vector from its direct ancestor;
that is, $\vct{t}_{i,j}:=\vct{t}_{i-1,j}$. The treatment of the special cases
of this inheritance-based approach will be described in greater detail in
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}.

From the mesh point $\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$, we wish to place a new mesh point
$\mathcal{M}_{i+1,j}$ at an intersection of the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and the
half-plane $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$ located a distance $\Delta_{i}$ from
$\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$. The aforementioned half-plane is defined by the coordinate
$\vct{x}_{i,j}$, the unit normal $\vct{t}_{i,j}$ and the guidance vector
$\vct{\rho}_{i,j}$ (cf.\ \cref{eq:innermost_prevvec,eq:general_prevvec}).
Note that this intersection may occur anywhere on the half-circle within
$\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$ of radius $\Delta_{i}$, centered at $\vct{x}_{i,j}$. The
search for a new mesh point is conducted by defining an aim point
$\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}$ within $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$, computed by performing a
single, classical, \nth{4}-order Runge-Kutta step (cf.\ \cref{tab:butcherrk4})
of length $\Delta_{i}$ in the vector field locally defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:faithful_intermediary_aimpoint_vectorfield}
    \vct{\psi}(\vct{x}) = %
    \frac{\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})\times\vct{t}_{i,j}}%
    {\norm{\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})\times\vct{t}_{i,j}}},
\end{equation}
starting at $\vct{x}_{i,j}$. Moreover, all of the vectors of the intermediary
Runge-Kutta evaluations of $\vct{\psi}(\vct{x})$ were corrected, if necessary,
by continuous comparison with $\vct{\rho}_{i,j}$ and sign-reversion if an
intermediary vector was directed radially inwards. Finally, the computed aim
point was projected into the half-plane $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$ as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:aimpoint_planeprojection}
    \vct{x}_{\text{aim}} := \vct{x}_{\text{aim}} - \inp[]{\vct{t}_{i,j}}%
    {\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}-\vct{x}}\vct{t}_{i,j}.
\end{equation}

The idea is then to look for a new position within $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$, in the
vicinity of $\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}$, at a distance $\Delta_{i}$ from
$\vct{x}_{i,j}$, by moving within the constraints of the manifold. Motivated by
\cref{rmk:invariance_lcs} --- on the invariance of the time-$t_{0}$ image of
repelling LCSs under perturbations in the local $\vct{\xi}_{1}$- and
$\vct{\xi}_{2}$-direction fields --- this involves computing trajectories which
everywhere l2ay within the plane spanned by the local $\vct{\xi}_{1}$- and
$\vct{\xi}_{2}$-vectors. This was done by defining a local, normalized
direction field as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:faithful_local_directionfield}
    \vct{\mu}(\vct{x},\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}) = %
    \frac{\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}-\vct{x} - \inp[]{\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})}%
    {\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}-\vct{x}}\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})}%
    {\norm{\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}-\vct{x} - \inp[]{\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})}%
    {\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}-\vct{x}}\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x})}},
\end{equation}
that is, the normalized projection of the vector separating $\vct{x}$ and
$\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}$ into the plane orthogonal to the local $\vct{\xi}_{3}$
vector, in accordance with LCS existence criterion~\eqref{eq:lcs_condition_c}.
A visual representation of this direction field is given in
\cref{fig:aim_procedure}. The choice of initial conditions for computing
trajectories within the manifold, with a view to expanding it, is the topic
of (the immediately forthcoming)
\cref{sub:selecting_initial_conditions_from_which_to_compute_new_mesh_points}.
