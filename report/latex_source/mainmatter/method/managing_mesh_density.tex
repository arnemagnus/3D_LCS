\section{Managing mesh accuracy}
\label{sec:managing_mesh_accuracy}

As will be described extensively in
\cref{sec:continuously_reconstructing_three_dimensional_manifold_surfaces_from%
_point_meshes},
the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ was extracted from its set of parametrization
points $\{\mathcal{M}_{i,j}\}$ by means of linear interpolation. In order to
keep the interpolation error in check, we sought to limit the distance
separating neighboring mesh points by means of pre-set upper and lower
boundaries --- in the following denoted $\Delta_{\min}$ and $\Delta_{\max}$,
respectively. Considering a set of mesh points as a holistic approximation of a
manifold, the separations between the mesh points in each level set, combined
with the interset step lengths $\{\Delta_{i}\}$, determine the overall
accuracy. Our algorithmic approach to maintaining the overall mesh quality will
be explained in the sections to follow.
