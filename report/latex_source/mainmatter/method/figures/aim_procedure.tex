   {Visualization of the direction field used to compute trajectories within a
   manifold, using the legacy approach. The normalized direction
   $\vct{\mu}(\vct{x},\vct{x}_{\text{aim}})$ is found by normalizing the
   projection of $\vct{x}_{\text{aim}} - \vct{x}$ into the plane spanned
   by the local $\vct{\xi}_{1}$- and $\vct{\xi}_{2}$ vectors (shaded).}
