    {Conceptual illustration of the special-purpose cubic interpolation routine
        for the Cauchy-Green strain eigenvectors. The 64 nearest grid points
        (16 in two dimensions; here shown in gray) to any given coordinate
        $\vct{x}$ are identified. As the local stretch is equal in magnitude
        along the negative $\vct{\xi}_{i}$ axis as that of its positive
        counterpart, we are free to reverse any $\vct{\xi}_{i}$ vector which is
        rotated more than $90\si{\degree}$ with regards to the chosen pivot
        vector (at the grid point denoted by $\mathcal{P}$) prior to
        interpolating the components of $\vct{\xi}_{i}$, making use of cubic
        B-splines. The vectors used in the local cubic interpolation are
        dashed, wherease the vectors which had to be reversed are dotted.
