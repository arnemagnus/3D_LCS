    {How the intersection-detection algorithm handles special cases.
        Triangles which share a common edge, as illustrated in
        (\subref*{fig:mollertrumbore_vertexshared}), form the premise of our
        triangulation algorithm; accordingly, this scenario does not get flagged
        as an intersection. Neither does the case when two triangles are
        identical (or one is contained within the other) --- which is not shown
        here --- nor the case when the edges of two triangles intersect in
        exactly two unique points, shown in
        (\subref*{fig:mollertrumbore_dualisect}). The latter is a very marginal
        case which hardly ever occurs, and, for our purposes, would invariably
        coincide with another (nearby) pair of triangles intersecting in a
        different manner than these special cases; ensuring that the computed
        level set as a whole would be flagged as self-intersecting.}
