    {Flowchart illustrating the algorithm for detecting self-intersections.
        In order to ensure that no self-intersection went unnoticed, the
        indicated procedure was carried out by comparing each of the
        interpolation triangles A in the most recently computed level set,
        to all of the triangles B in the previously computed level sets.
        Provided that any of the new triangles intersected any of the old ones,
        the new level set as a whole was flagged as self-intersecting. The
        main weakness of this approach is illustrated in
        \emph{\textbf{SETT INN REF TIL M\"oller-Trumbore-figur!}}.
