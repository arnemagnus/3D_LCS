    {Our approach to limit the compound numerical error, by continuously
    removing unwanted loops in the computed level sets. As the separation
between the mesh points $\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{i,j+k}$
satisfies the restrictions regarding mesh point density
(cf.\ \cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}), the mesh points
${\{\mathcal{M}_{i,j+\kappa}\}}_{\kappa=1}^{k-1}$ (shown in a lighter
shade of gray) are removed, provided that the cumulative neighbor separation
around the bulge is sufficiently large (per the conditions presented in
\cref{eq:loop_removal_conditions}) --- which is the case in the above.
The resulting interpolation curve $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ becomes significantly
more well-behaved without the superfluous mesh points.
