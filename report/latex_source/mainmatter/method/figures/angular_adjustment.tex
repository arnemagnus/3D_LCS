    {The principles of curvature-guided interset step length adjustment. For
        each of the mesh points $\{\mathcal{M}_{i+1,j}\}$ constituting the
        level set $\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$, the angular offsets $\alpha_{i,j}$
        between the guidance vectors $\vct{\rho}_{i,j}$ (dashdotted) and
        $\vct{\rho}_{i+1,j}$ (not shown, but parallel to the vector separating
        $\mathcal{M}_{i,j}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{i+1,j}$, shown in solid) were
        computed. These were used in conjunction with $\Delta_{i}$, the interset
        step used to  compute the new mesh points, in order to determine whether
        or not the suggested level set would have to be discarded due to the
        local curvature along at least one point strain being sufficiently large
        to comply with criterion~\eqref{eq:decrease_dist}. If the level set was
        deemed acceptable, local curvature estimates $\{\alpha_{i,j}\}$ and
        $\{\Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j}\}$ were then used to determine if the
        \emph{subsequent} level set $\mathcal{M}_{i+2}$ could be computed
        using $\Delta_{i+1}>\Delta_{i}$; namely, if criterion
        \eqref{eq:increase_dist} was satisfied.
