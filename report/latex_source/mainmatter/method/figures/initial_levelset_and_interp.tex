    {The construction of the innermost geodesic level set. An initial
        condition $\vct{x}_{0}$ is found by means of the method outlined in
        \cref{sub:identifying_suitable_initial_conditions_for_developing_lcss}.
        A set of $n$ meshpoints $\{\mathcal{M}_{1,j}\}_{j=1}^{n}$ is then
        evenly distributed within the plane defined by the point $\vct{x}_{0}$
        and the unit normal $\vct{\xi}_{3}(\vct{x}_{0})$, which is shaded. Each
        mesh point is separated from $\vct{x}_{0}$ by a small distance
        $\delta_{\text{init}}$ (dashed). Using a normalized pseudo-arclength
        parameter $s$, the mesh point coordinates are interpolated using cubic
        B-splines, forming the smooth curve $\mathcal{C}_{1}$ (dotted).
