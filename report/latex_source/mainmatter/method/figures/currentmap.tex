    {Stereographical map projection of the Førde fjord and its surroundings.
        The local fjord depths are indicated by a varying background color. A
        subset of the gridded velocity vectors indicates the macroscopic trends
        of the oceanic currents at a depth of $50\,\si{\meter}$ below the
        surface. Outlined in white is a bird's-eye view of the main region of
        interest; namely, a region of water which was neither particularly
        close to the oceanic surface, nor struck the coastline when advected
        during the 18 hour time interval of interest.}
