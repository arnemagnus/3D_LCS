\subsection{Choosing new trajectory start points by an algorithm with memory}
\label{sub:choosing_new_trajectory_start_points_by_an_algorithm_with_memory}

Our method of choosing parameter values $\breve{s}$ corresponding to points
along $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ (cf.\ \cref{eq:faithful_initialcondition_interval}),
from which to compute trajectories of the direction field given by
\cref{eq:faithful_local_directionfield} --- with the intention of computing new
mesh points --- rests on the assumption that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:faithful_endpoint_separation}
    \Delta(\breve{s}) := \norm{\vct{x}_{\text{fin}}(\breve{s})-\vct{x}_{i,j}},%
    \quad \vct{x}_{\text{fin}}\in\mathcal{H}_{i,j}
\end{equation}
is a continuous function of $\breve{s}$. To this end, we keep track of
why each computed trajectory is terminated. In particular, we first note
whether or not each trajectory, corresponding to a start point
$\vct{x}(\breve{s})$, ends up at some point
$\vct{x}_{\text{fin}}\in\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$. If this is the case, we also note
whether the corresponding separation $\Delta(\breve{s})$ (defined in
\cref{eq:faithful_endpoint_separation}) was an over- or
undershoot with regards to the desired separation $\Delta_{i}$.

Based on the premises outlined above, we then make use of the intermediate
value theorem; specifically, if we have
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:faithful_IVT_part_one}
        \Delta(\breve{s}_{1}) < \Delta_{i},\quad \Delta(\breve{s}_{2}) >
        \Delta_{i}
    \end{equation}
    for $\breve{s}_{1} < \breve{s}_{2}$, then the intermediate value theorem
    implies that there must exist an $\breve{s}$, such that
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:faithful_IVT_part_two}
        \Delta(\breve{s}) = \Delta_{i}, \quad \breve{s}_{1} < \breve{s} %
        < \breve{s}_{2},
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
under the assumption that $\Delta(\breve{s})$ is a continuous function. In
order to optimize our use of computational resources, we thus endeavor to take
large steps when moving along $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ whenever the computed
intersections with $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$ are far from fulfilling
$\Delta(\breve{s}) = \Delta_{i}$. However, when a subinterval of
$\mathcal{C}_{i}$ is identified, within which the intermediate value theorem
suggests that a trajectory may fulfill our requirements, we decrease the
(quasi-)arclength increment $\delta\breve{s}$ in order to increase our odds of
finding said trajectory. While the purpose of $\delta\breve{s}_{\min}$ was to
manage resource requirements, $\delta\breve{s}_{\max}$ was used in order to
avoid bypassing subsets of $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ from which two or more
trajectories satisfy $\Delta(\breve{s}) = \Delta_{i}$. Overstepping a region
containing an even number of such intersections could render it undetectable
using our algorithm (see \cref{fig:s_update_flowchart}), as no change in
trajectory termination status need be detected.

The feedback received by tracking why each trajectory is terminated, allows
us to dynamically select new trajectory start points along $\mathcal{C}_{i}$.
We do so by increasing the (quasi-)arclength increment $\delta\breve{s}$ as
long as there is no change in trajectory termination status, and, conversely,
backtracking and reducing $\delta\breve{s}$ when a status change is detected.
This process is shown schematically in \cref{fig:s_update_flowchart}. As we
assume asymptotic behaviour close to any regions in which $\Delta(\breve{s})$
is not defined (that is, regions where no trajectories reach the half-plane
$\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$, cf.\ \cref{eq:faithful_endpoint_separation}), the
adjustment of $\delta\breve{s}$ is treated in the same fashion there.
