\subsection{Selecting initial conditions from which to compute new mesh points}
\label{sub:selecting_initial_conditions_from_which_to_compute_new_mesh_points}

As suggested by \textcite{krauskopf2005survey}, the starting point for all
trajectories intended to reach $\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}$ could be chosen as any
point not equal to $\vct{x}_{i,j}$ along the parametrized curve
$\mathcal{C}_{i}$. However, trajectories starting out at points along
$\mathcal{C}_{i}$ which are far removed from $\vct{x}_{i,j}$ are likely to
require a long integration path, which would result in an increase in the
accumulated numerical round-off error. Subject to such errors, these
trajectories might not even get close to $\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}$ with
a reasonable computational resource consumption. Accordingly, we limited the
potential number of trajectories to compute by only considering a subset of the
interpolation curve $\mathcal{C}_{i}$ as initial conditions, as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:faithful_initialcondition_interval}
    \vct{x}_{\text{init}} = \mathcal{C}_{i}(\breve{s}),\quad %
    \breve{s}\in\big\{[s_{j}-\varsigma,s_{j})\cup(s_{j},s_{j}+\varsigma]\big\},\quad%
    0<\varsigma\leq\frac{1}{2},
\end{equation}
where the inherent periodicity of the (quasi-)arclength parametrization of
$\mathcal{C}_{i}$ is implicitly applied. Here, $\varsigma$ was set to $0.1$,
ensuring that $20$ \% of all possible initial conditions along $\mathcal{C}_{i}$
were considered.

For computing trajectories whose initial conditions are given by
\cref{eq:faithful_initialcondition_interval} and direction fields given by
\cref{eq:faithful_local_directionfield}, the Dormand-Prince 8(7) adaptive
ODE solver (cf.\ \cref{tab:butcherdopri87,%
sub:the_implementation_of_dynamic_runge_kutta_step_size}) was the method of
choice. In order to ensure that any trajectory did not overstep the half-plane
$\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$ in passing, the step length was continuously limited from
above by $\norm{\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}-\vct{x}}$. Moreover, in order to avoid
spending unreasonable computational resources on trajectories which for
practical purposes never would result in acceptable, new mesh points, the
total allowed integration arclength was limited by a scalar multiple of
the initial separation $\norm{\vct{x}_{\text{init}}-\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}}$.
In particular, this limitation meant that trajectories which ended in
stable orbits around $\vct{x}_{\text{aim}}$ were not allowed to keep going
indefinitely.

If any trajectory terminated in a point $\vct{x}_{\text{fin}}$
which lied within the half-plane $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$ at a distance
$\Delta_{i}$ from $\vct{x}_{i,j}$, then $\vct{x}_{\text{fin}}$ was used as
coordinates for a new mesh point $\mathcal{M}_{i+1,j}$. Numerically, these
checks were implemented by means of tolerance parameters, as comparing
floating-point numbers for equivalence is prone to numerical round-off error.
More precisely, a point $\vct{x}$ was said to lie within $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$
provided that
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:plane_tolerance}
    \vct{\eta}: = \frac{\vct{x}-\vct{x}_{i,j}}{\norm{\vct{x}-\vct{x}_{i,j}}};%
    \quad \abs{\inp[]{\vct{\eta}}{\vct{t}_{i,j}}} < \gamma_{\mathcal{H}},
\end{equation}
whereas
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:dist_tolerance}
    \abs{\frac{\norm{\vct{x}-\vct{x}_{i,j}}}{\Delta_{i}}-1} < \gamma_{\Delta}
\end{equation}
sufficed for it to be flagged as lying a distance $\Delta_{i}$ from
$\vct{x}_{i,j}$, with $\gamma_{\mathcal{H}}$ and $\gamma_{\Delta}$ small
numbers. When a trajectory first intersected $\mathcal{H}_{i,j}$, the
integration was stopped abrubtly, leaving its endpoint $\vct{x}_{\text{fin}}$
as its suggested coordinates for the new mesh point. As briefly mentioned in
\cref{sub:parametrizing_the_innermost_level_set}, the unit tangent vectors
$\vct{t}_{i,j}$ were generally inherited --- the treatment of special cases
will be explained in greater detail in
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}. \Cref{fig:faithful_point_generation}
depicts a few characteristic trajectory patterns which commonly occured when
searching for new mesh points in the fashion discussed in the above.
