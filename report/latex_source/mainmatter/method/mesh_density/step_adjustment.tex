\subsection{A curvature-based approach to determining interset separations}
\label{sub:a_curvature_based_approach_to_determining_interset_separations}

Given the interpoint separation constraints described in
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}, we have some flexibility regarding
the choice of interset step length $\Delta_{i}$. In an approach closely
mirroring that of \textcite{krauskopf2005survey}, we used the (approximate)
local curvatures along each point strain (i.e.,\ the set of mesh points
which can be traced back to a common ancestor) in order to determine
whether or not the local manifold dynamics were resolved to a satisfactory
level of detail. Starting out with an initial interset separation
$\Delta_{1}=2\Delta_{\min}$ for the second innermost level set (i.e.,\, the
first level set which was computed using the method described in
\cref{sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points}), we sought to
ensure that the subsequent $\Delta_{i}$ resulted in the encapsulation of the
finer details of the growing manifolds.

Specifically, once all mesh points which constitute a geodesic level set
$\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$ have been identified, all a distance $\Delta_{i}$ away from
their direct ancestor points in the previous level set $\mathcal{M}_{i}$, we
computed the angular offsets $\alpha_{i,j}$ of each pair of guidance vectors
$\vct{\rho}_{i,j}$ and $\vct{\rho}_{i+1,j}$ (as defined in
\cref{eq:innermost_prevvec,eq:general_prevvec}). This is sketched in
\cref{fig:angular_adjustment}. If
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decrease_dist}
    \alpha_{i,j} > \alpha_{\downarrow} \quad \text{or} \quad %
    \Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j} > (\Delta\alpha)_{\downarrow} \quad %
    \text{for at least one } j,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{\downarrow}$ and $(\Delta\alpha)_{\downarrow}$ are upper
curvature tolerance parameters, was satisfied, the level set $\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$
was discarded and recomputed with reduced $\Delta_{i}$. If $\Delta_{i}$ was
already as low as the pre-set $\Delta_{\min}$, the manifold generation
process was terminated, as a new level set $\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$ could not be
computed under the given constraints on interpoint separation (cf.\
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}). Conversely, if
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:increase_dist}
    \alpha_{i,j} < \alpha_{\uparrow} \quad \text{and} \quad %
    \Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j} < (\Delta\alpha)_{\uparrow} \quad %
    \text{for all } j,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{\uparrow}$ and $(\Delta\alpha)_{\uparrow}$ are lower curvature
tolerance parameters, was satisfied, the interset distance for computing the
\emph{next} level set, $\Delta_{i+1}$, was made bigger than $\Delta_{i}$
(although never beyond the pre-set $\Delta_{\max}$).

As is evident from \cref{eq:decrease_dist,eq:increase_dist}, the parameters
$\alpha_{\downarrow}$, $\alpha_{\uparrow}$, $(\Delta\alpha)_{\downarrow}$ and
$(\Delta\alpha)_{\uparrow}$ determine the mesh adaption along point strains.
Choosing appropriate bounds for the offsets $\{\Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j}\}$
allows for stricter requirements on angular offsets for large interstep lengths.
Similarly, level sets computed using small interset lenghts are allowed
(comparatively) larger angular offsets in general. In our experience, the
interset step lenghts were rarely \emph{increased}  --- typically, there would
be one or more subsets of the mesh points constituting any given level set which
underwent sufficient curvature such that condition~\eqref{eq:increase_dist} did
not hold.
