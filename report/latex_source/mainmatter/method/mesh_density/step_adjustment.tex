\subsection{A curvature-based approach to determining interset separations}
\label{sub:a_curvature_based_approach_to_determining_interset_separations}

Given the interpoint separation constraints described in
\cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}, we have some flexibility regarding
the choice of interset step length $\Delta_{i}$. In an approach closely
mirroring that of \textcite{krauskopf2005survey}, we used the (approximate)
local curvatures along each point strand (i.e.,\ the set of mesh points
which can be traced back to a common ancestor) in order to determine
whether or not the local manifold dynamics were resolved to a satisfactory
level of detail. Starting out with an initial interset separation
$\Delta_{1}=2\Delta_{\min}$ for the second innermost level set (i.e.,\, the
first level set which was computed using the method described in
\cref{sec:revised_approach_to_computing_new_mesh_points}), we sought to
ensure that the subsequent $\Delta_{i}$ resulted in the encapsulation of the
finer details of the growing manifolds.

Specifically, once all mesh points which constitute a geodesic level set
$\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$ had been identified, all a distance $\Delta_{i}$ away from
their direct ancestor points in the previous level set $\mathcal{M}_{i}$, we
computed the angular offsets $\alpha_{i,j}$ between each pair of guidance
vectors $\vct{\rho}_{i,j}$ and $\vct{\rho}_{i+1,j}$ (as defined in
\cref{eq:innermost_prevvec,eq:general_prevvec}). This is sketched in
\cref{fig:angular_adjustment}.  Note, however, that angular offsets for mesh
points computed from ficticious ancestors in order to maintain the mesh point
density (see \cref{sub:maintaining_mesh_point_density}), were not computed. If
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:decrease_dist}
    \alpha_{i,j} > \alpha_{\downarrow} \quad \text{or} \quad %
    \Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j} > (\Delta\alpha)_{\downarrow} \quad %
    \text{for at least one } j,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{\downarrow}$ and $(\Delta\alpha)_{\downarrow}$ are upper
curvature tolerance parameters, was satisfied, the level set
$\mathcal{M}_{i+1}$ was discarded and recomputed with reduced $\Delta_{i}$.
However, $\Delta_{i}$ was never reduced below $\Delta_{\min}$. Conversely, if
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:increase_dist}
    \alpha_{i,j} < \alpha_{\uparrow} \quad \text{and} \quad %
    \Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j} < (\Delta\alpha)_{\uparrow} \quad %
    \text{for all } j,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{\uparrow}$ and $(\Delta\alpha)_{\uparrow}$ are lower curvature
tolerance parameters, was satisfied, the interset distance for computing the
\emph{next} level set, $\Delta_{i+1}$, was made bigger than $\Delta_{i}$
(although never beyond the pre-set $\Delta_{\max}$).

As is evident from \cref{eq:decrease_dist,eq:increase_dist}, the parameters
$\alpha_{\downarrow}$, $\alpha_{\uparrow}$, $(\Delta\alpha)_{\downarrow}$ and
$(\Delta\alpha)_{\uparrow}$ determine the mesh adaption along point strands.
The bounds for the offsets $\{\Delta_{i}\cdot\alpha_{i,j}\}$ enforce stricter
requirements on angular offsets for large interstep lengths. Conversely, level
sets computed using small interset lengths are generally allowed to exhibit
(comparatively) larger angular offsets. In our experience, the interset step
lengths were rarely \emph{increased}  --- typically, there would be one or more
subsets of the mesh points constituting any given level set which underwent
sufficient curvature such that condition~\eqref{eq:increase_dist} did not hold.
