\subsection{The Runge-Kutta family of numerical ODE solvers}
\label{sub:the_runge_kutta_family_of_numerical_ode_solvers}

In numerical analysis, the Runge-Kutta family of methods is a popular collection
of implicit and explicit iterative methods, used in temporal discretization in
order to obtain numerical approximations of the \emph{true} solutions of systems
like~\eqref{eq:ivpsystem}. The German mathematicians C. Runge and M.W. Kutta
developed the first of the family's methods at the turn of the twentieth
century~\parencite[p.134]{hairer1993solving}. The general outline of what
is now known as a Runge-Kutta method is as follows:

\begin{defn}[Runge-Kutta methods]
    \label{def:runge_kutta_methods}
    Let $s$ be an integer and $\{a_{i,j}\}_{i,j=1}^{s}$, %_{\substack{i=1\\j=1}}^{s}$,
    $\{b_{i}\}_{i=1}^{s}$ and $\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{s}$ be real coefficients.\hfill\newline
    Let $h$ be the numerical step length used in the temporal discretization.\hfill\newline
    Then, the method
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:generalrungekutta}
        \begin{aligned}
        k_{i} &= f\bigg(t_{n} + c_{i}h, x_{n} + h\sum\limits_{j=1}^{s}a_{i,j}k_{j}\bigg), \quad{}i=1,\ldots,s,\\
        x_{n+1} &= x_{n} + h\sum\limits_{i=1}^{s}b_{i}k_{i},
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
    is called an \emph{s-stage Runge-Kutta method} for the system
    \eqref{eq:ivpsystem}.
\end{defn}

The main reason to include multiple stages in a Runge-Kutta method is to
improve the numerical accuracy of the computed solutions. The \emph{order} of a
Runge-Kutta method can be defined as follows:

\begin{defn}[Order of Runge-Kutta methods]
    \label{def:runge_kutta_order}
    A Runge-Kutta method, given by~\cref{eq:generalrungekutta}, is of
    \emph{order p} if, for sufficiently smooth systems~\eqref{eq:ivpsystem},
    the local error $e_{n}$ scales as $h^{p+1}$. That is:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:rungekuttaorder}
        e_{n} = \norm{x_{n}-u_{n-1}(t_{n})} \leq K\hspace{0.5ex}h^{p+1}
    \end{equation}
    where $u_{n-1}(t)$ is the exact solution of the ODE in system
    \eqref{eq:ivpsystem} at time $t$, subject to the initial condition
    $u_{n-1}(t_{n-1}) = x_{n-1}$, and $K$ is a numerical constant. This is true,
    if the Taylor series for the exact solution $u_{n-1}(t_{n})$ and the
    numerical solution $x_{n}$ coincide up to (and including) the term $h^{p}$.
\end{defn}%
The \emph{global} error
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:globalrungekuttaerror}
    E_{n} = x_{n}-x(t_{n}),
\end{equation}
where $x(t)$ is the exact solution of system~\eqref{eq:ivpsystem} at time $t$,
accumulated by $n$ repeated applications of the numerical method, can be
estimated by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:globalrungekuttaerrorapprox}
    \abs{E_{n}} \leq C\sum\limits_{l=1}^{n}\abs{e_{l}},
\end{equation}
where $C$ is a numerical constant, depending on both the right hand side of the
ODE in system~\eqref{eq:ivpsystem} and the difference $t_{n}-t_{0}$. Making
use of~\cref{def:runge_kutta_order}, the global error is limited from above by
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:globalrungekuttaerrorestimate}
    \begin{aligned}
        \abs{E_{n}} &\leq C\sum\limits_{l=1}^{n}\abs{e_{l}} %
        \leq C\sum\limits_{l=1}^{n}\abs{K_{l}}\hspace{0.5ex}h^{p+1}%
        \leq C\hspace{0.5ex}\max\limits_{l}\big\{\abs{K_{l}}\big\}\hspace{0.5ex}n\hspace{0.5ex}h^{p+1}\\
        &\leq C\hspace{0.5ex}\max\limits_{l}\big\{\abs{K_{l}}\big\}\hspace{0.5ex}\frac{t_{n}-t_{0}}{h}\hspace{0.5ex}h^{p+1}
        \leq \widetilde{K}\hspace{0.5ex}h^{p},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{K}$ is a numerical constant.
\Cref{eq:globalrungekuttaerrorestimate} demonstrates that, for a \emph{p}-th
order Runge-Kutta method, the global error can be expected to scale as $h^{p}$.

In \cref{def:runge_kutta_methods}, the matrix $(a_{i,j})$ is commonly called
the \emph{Runge-Kutta matrix}, while the coefficients $\{b_{i}\}$ and
$\{c_{i}\}$ are known as the \emph{weights} and \emph{nodes}, respectively.
Since the 1960s, it has been customary to represent Runge-Kutta methods, given
by~\cref{eq:generalrungekutta}, symbolically, by means of mnemonic devices known
as Butcher tableaus \parencite[p.134]{hairer1993solving}. The Butcher tableau
for a general \emph{s}-stage Runge-Kutta method, as introduced in
\cref{def:runge_kutta_methods}, is presented in \cref{tab:generalbutcher}.
For explicit Runge-Kutta methods, the Runge-Kutta matrix $(a_{i,j})$ is lower
triangular. Similarly, for fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods, the Runge-Kutta
matrix is upper triangular. The difference between explicit and implicit
methods is outlined in~\cref{eq:exim}.

During the first half of the twentieth century, a substantial amount of research
was conducted in order to develop numerically robust, high-order, explicit
Runge-Kutta methods. The idea was that using such methods would mean one could
resort to larger time increments $h$ without sacrificing precision in the
computed solution. However, the required number of stages $s$ grows quicker than
linearly as a function of the required order $p$. It has been proven that, for
$p\geq5$, no explicit Runge-Kutta method of order $p$ with $s=p$ stages exists
\parencite[p.173]{hairer1993solving}. This is one of the reasons for the
attention shift from the latter half of the 1950s and onwards, towards so-called
\emph{embedded} Runge-Kutta methods.

The basic idea of embedded Runge-Kutta methods is that they, aside from the
numerical approximation $x_{n+1}$, yield a second approximation
$\widehat{x}_{n+1}$. The difference between the two approximations then
provides an estimate of the local error of the less precise result, which can
be used for automatic step size control
\parencite[pp.167--168]{hairer1993solving}. The trick is to construct two
independent, explicit Runge-Kutta methods which both use the \emph{same}
function evaluations. This results in practically obtaining the two solutions
for the price of one, in terms of computational complexity. The Butcher tableau
of a generic, embedded, explicit Runge-Kutta method is illustrated in
\cref{tab:genericembeddedbutcher}.

For embedded methods, the coefficients are tuned such that
\begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:embeddedsol}
        x_{n+1} = x_{n} + h\sum\limits_{i=1}^{s}b_{i}k_{i}
    \end{equation}
    is of order $p$, and
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:embeddedinterp}
        \widehat{x}_{n+1} = x_{n} + h\sum\limits_{i=1}^{s}\widehat{b}_{i}k_{i}
    \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
is of order $\widehat{p}$, typically with $\widehat{p} = p + 1$. Which of the
solutions is used to continue the numerical integration, depends on the
integration method in question. In the following, the solution which is
\emph{not} used to continue the integration, will be referred to as the
\emph{interpolant} solution.

There exists an abundance of Runge-Kutta methods; many of which are fine-tuned
for specific constraints, such as problems of varying degrees of stiffness.
Based on prior investigations --- such as the work done by
\textcite{loken2017sensitivity} --- using explicit, high order, embedded
Runge-Kutta methods to compute Lagrangian coherent structures
(which will be elaborated upon in \textbf{\emph{SETT INN REF}})
consistently yields accurate solutions at lower computational cost than
the most common fixed stepsize methods. Accordingly, the Dormand-Prince 8(7)
method --- consisting of an eighth order solution with a seventh order
interpolant --- was chosen as the single, multipurpose, numerical ODE solver
for this project.

Note that the concept of \emph{order} is less well-defined for embedded
methods than for fixed stepsize methods, as a direct consequence of the
adaptive time step. Although the \emph{local} errors of each integration
step scale as per~\cref{eq:rungekuttaorder}, the bound on the \emph{global}
(i.e.,\ observable) error suggested in~\cref{eq:globalrungekuttaerrorestimate}
is invalid, as the time step is, in principle, different for each integration
step. A Butcher tableau representation of the Dormand-Prince 8(7) method
is available in~\cref{tab:butcherdopri87}, which has been typeset in
landscape mode for the reader's convenience. Details on how the dynamic
time step was implemented will be presented in \textbf{\emph{SETT INN REF}}.
