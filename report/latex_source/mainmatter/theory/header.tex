This chapter contains introduces the mathematical principles which form the
foundation of our approach to computing Lagrangian coherent structures in
three-dimensional flow systems numerically.
\Cref{sec:solving_systems_of_ordinary_differential_equations} provides a
concise description of how numerical integrators (that is, Runge-Kutta
solvers) in addition to interpolation methods allow for solving systems
of ordinary differential equations numerically. Then,
\cref{sec:the_type_of_flow_systems_considered} introduces what we define as
\emph{flow systems}, in addition to providing a concise description of the
underlying mathematics upon which Lagrangian flow analysis is based. Lastly,
\cref{sec:definition_of_lagrangian_coherent_structures_for_three_dimensional%
_flows} contains a succinct introduction to Lagrangian coherent structures;
perhaps most notably, necessary and sufficent existence criteria for
\emph{hyperbolic} three-dimensional Lagrangian coherent structures --- which
arise from their underlying variational theory --- are presented.
