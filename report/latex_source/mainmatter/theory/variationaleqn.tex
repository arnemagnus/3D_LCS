From \cref{eq:consideredflow,eq:defn_flowmap}, one finds the following ordinary
differential equation for the flow map:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:timederivative_flowmap}
    \dot{\vct{\phi}} = \vct{v}(t,\vct{\phi}),
\end{equation}
where $t_{0}$, $t$ and $\vct{x}_{0}$ have been emitted in order to avoid
notational clutter. These are, however, implicit by context. As the nabla
operator is independent of time, \cref{eq:timederivative_flowmap} immediately
yields an ordinary differential equation for the directional derivative of the
flow map
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:timederivative_directionalderivative_flowmap}
    \dv{\phantom{}}{t}\big(\uvct{u}\cdot\grad\big)\vct{\phi} = %
        \big(\uvct{u}\cdot\grad\big)\vct{v}(t,\vct{\phi}),
\end{equation}
along any constant unit vector $\uvct{u}$. On a regular Cartesian grid,
this reduces to
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:timederivative_flowmap_jacobian}
    \dv{\phantom{}}{t}\bigg(\pdv{\phi_{i}}{x_{j}}\bigg) = %
    \sum\limits_{k} \pdv{v_{i}}{x_{k}}\bigg|_{(t,\vct{\phi})}\,%
                    \pdv{\phi_{k}}{x_{j}}\bigg|_{t}, \quad
    \pdv{\phi_{i}}{x_{j}}\bigg|_{t_{0}} = \delta_{ij}, \quad \hskip0.5em %
    t \in [t_{0},t_{1}], \quad \vct{x}_{0}\in\mathcal{U},
\end{equation}
where the Kronecker delta is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:kroneckerdelta}
    \delta_{ij} = %
    \begin{cases}
        1, & \text{if }i=j\\
        0, & \text{if }i\neq{}j.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The initial conditions reflect the fact that, for a regular Cartesian grid,
the directional derivative of the $x$ coordinate in the $x$ direction is $1$,
but zero in the $y$ and $z$ directions.
