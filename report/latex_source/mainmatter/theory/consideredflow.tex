\section{The type of flow systems considered}

We consider flow in three-dimensional dynamical systems of the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:consideredflow}
    \dot{\vct{x}} = \vct{v}(t,\vct{x}), \quad \vct{x}\in\mathcal{U},%
    \quad t\in[t_{0},t_{1}],
\end{equation}
i.e., systems defined for the finite time interval $[t_{0},t_{1}]$ on an open,
bounded subset $\mathcal{U}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$. In addition, the velocity
field $\vct{v}$ is assumed to be smooth in its arguments. Depending on the
exact nature of the velocity field $\vct{v}$, analytical particle trajectories,
that is, analytical solutions of system \eqref{eq:consideredflow}, may or may
not exist. The flow particles are assumed to be infinitesimal and massless,
i.e., non-interacting \emph{tracers} of the overall circulation.

Letting $\vct{x}(t;t_{0},\vct{x}_{0})$ denote the trajectory of a tracer in
the system given by \cref{eq:consideredflow}, the flow map is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defn_flowmap}
    \vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0}) = \vct{x}(t;t_{0},\vct{x}_{0}),
\end{equation}
hence, the flow map describes the movement of tracers from one point in time
to another mathematically. In general, the flow map is as smooth as the
underlying velocity field (cf.\ system \eqref{eq:consideredflow})
\parencite{farazmand2012computing}. For sufficiently smooth velocity fields, the
right Cauchy-Green strain tensor field can be defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defn_cauchygreen}
    \mtrx{C}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0}) = %
    \Big(\grad\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0})\Big)^{\ast}%
    \Big(\grad\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0})\Big),
\end{equation}
where $\grad\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}$ denotes the Jacobian matrix of the flow
map $\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}$, and the asterisk refers to the adjoint operation,
which, because the Jacobian $\grad\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}$ is real-valued,
equates to matrix transposition. Component-wise, the Jacobian matrix of a
general vector-valued function $\vct{f}$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:defn_jacobian}
    (\grad\vct{f})_{i,j} = \pdv{f_{i}}{x_{j}}, \quad%
    \vct{f} = \vct{f}(\vct{x}) = \big(f_{1}(\vct{x}),f_{2}(\vct{x}),\ldots\big),
\end{equation}
which, for our three-dimensional flow, reduces to
\begingroup
\setlength{\delimitershortfall}{0pt}
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:jacobian_3d}
    \grad\vct{f} = %
    \begin{pmatrix}%
        \dpdv{f_{1}}{x} & \dpdv{f_{1}}{y} & \dpdv{f_{1}}{z} \\[2ex]
        \dpdv{f_{2}}{x} & \dpdv{f_{2}}{y} & \dpdv{f_{2}}{z} \\[2ex]
        \dpdv{f_{3}}{x} & \dpdv{f_{3}}{y} & \dpdv{f_{3}}{z}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
\endgroup
Because the Jacobian of the flow map is invertible, the Cauchy-Green strain
tensor $\mtrx{C}_{t_{0}}^{t}$ is symmetric and positive definite
\parencite{farazmand2012computing}. Thus, it has three real, positive
eigenvalues and orthogonal, real eigenvectors. Its eigenvalues $\lambda_{i}$
and corresponding unit eigenvectors $\vct{\xi}_{i}$ are defined by%
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cauchygreen_characteristics}
    \begin{gathered}
        \mtrx{C}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0})\vct{\xi}_{i}(\vct{x}_{0}) = %
        \lambda_{i}\vct{\xi}_{i}(\vct{x}_{0}), \quad %
        \norm{\vct{\xi}_{i}(\vct{x}_{0})} = 1, \quad i = 1, 2, 3, \\
        0 < \lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0}) \leq \lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0}) %
        \leq \lambda_{3}(\vct{x}_{0}),
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation}
where, for the sake of notational transparency, the dependence of $\lambda_{i}$
and $\vct{\xi}_{i}$ on $t_{0}$ and $t$ has been suppressed. The geometric
interpretation of \cref{eq:cauchygreen_characteristics} is that a fluid element
undergoes the most stretching along the $\vct{\xi}_{3}$ axis, less stretching
along the $\vct{\xi}_{2}$ axis, and the least stretching along the
$\vct{\xi}_{1}$ axis. This concept is shown in \cref{fig:stretch_and_strain}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \input{figures/stretch_and_strain.tex}
    \caption[Geometric interpretation of the eigenvectors of the Cauchy-Green
    strain tensor]{Geometrix interpretation of the eigenvectors of the
    Cauchy-Green strain tensor. The central unit cell is stretched and deformed
    under the flow map $\vct{F}_{t_{0}}^{t}(\vct{x}_{0})$. The local stretching
    is the largest in the direction of $\vct{\xi}_{3}$, the eigenvector which
    corresponds to the largest eigenvalue, $\lambda_{3}$, of the Cauchy-Green
    strain tensor, defined in \cref{eq:cauchygreen_characteristics}. Along
    the $\vct{\xi}_{i}$ axes, the stretch factors are given by
    $\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}$, respectively.}
    \label{fig:stretch_and_strain}
\end{figure}

As the stretch factors along the $\vct{\xi}_{i}$ axes are given by the
square roots of the corresponding eigenvalues, for incompressible flow, the
eigenvalues satisfy
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:cauhygreen_incompressibility}
    \lambda_{1}(\vct{x}_{0})
    \lambda_{2}(\vct{x}_{0})
    \lambda_{3}(\vct{x}_{0}) = 1 \quad \forall \hskip0.5em %
    \vct{x}_{0}\in\mathcal{U},
\end{equation}
where, in the context of tracer advection, incompressibility is equivalent
to the velocity field $\vct{v}$ being
divergence-free (i.e.,\ $\div\vct{v}\equiv0$ in system
\eqref{eq:consideredflow}).
