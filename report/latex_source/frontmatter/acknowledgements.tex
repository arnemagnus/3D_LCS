I would like to extend my gratitude to my supervisor, Assoc.\ Prof.\ Tor
Nordam. Our many discussions over the past academic year has provided me with
great insight, while his great knowledge and humour proved excellent tools in
terms of relaxing my early-semester nerves. Coupled with his expertise
concerning the use of supercomputers for scientific purposes --- without the
use of which, none of the computations constituting the results presented in
this thesis would have been practically feasible --- I could not be more
satisfied.

My good friend and fellow student Simon Nordgreen, who, much like me, thrived
under the guidance of Assoc.\ Prof.\ Nordam, definitely deserves a mention. Like
for our specialization projects which took place last semester, we have
collaborated closely for our respective master's theses work. Our many thorough
discussions, and sessions of intensive work, have been invaluable to further
enhance my understanding of the underlying variational principles which form
the basis of our investigations. Looking back at what we have achieved over the
past year, I think it is safe to say that two heads are better than one.

Last, but most certainly not least, I gratefully thank my family for their
unconditional support and encouragement throughout.
