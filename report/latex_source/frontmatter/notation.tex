Newton's notation is used for differentiation with respect to time, i.e.:

\[\dot{f}(t) \equiv \dv{f(t)}{t}.\]

Vectors are denoted by lowercase, upright, bold letters, like this:

\[\vct{\xi} = \big(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},\ldots,\xi_{n}\big).\]

The Euclidean inner product for two vectors
$(\vct{\xi},\vct{\psi})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is denoted by:

\[\inp[]{\vct{\xi}}{\vct{\psi}} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\xi_{i}\psi_{i}.\]

The Euclidean norm of a vector $\vct{\xi}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is designated as:

\[\norm{\vct{\xi}} = \sqrt{\inp[]{\vct{\xi}}{\vct{\xi}}}.\]

Matrices and matrix representations of rank-2 tensors are denoted by
uppercase, upright, bold letters, as follows:

\[\mtrx{A} = (a_{i,j}) = %
\begin{pmatrix}%
a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n} \\
\end{pmatrix}%
.\]
